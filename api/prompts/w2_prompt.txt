Extract the following key entities and return them in a JSON format:

- Employer Information:
  - Employer Name
  - Employer Identification Number (EIN)
  - Employer Address (including City, State, and ZIP Code)

  - Employee Name (Full Name)
  - Employee Social Security Number (SSN) (mask all except last 4 digits, e.g., XXX-XX-1234)

  - Date of Signing (if available)

- Wages & Taxes:
  - Wages, Tips, and Other Compensation (Box 1)

- Additional Information:

Ensure that:
- The JSON response contains proper keys with extracted values.
- If any field is missing, return an empty string for that key.
- If you are unsure of any value for a given field, return an empty string for that key.
- Mask all but the last 4 digits of the SSN (e.g., XXX-XX-1234).
- Return the extracted entities as a **valid JSON object**.
